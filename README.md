Cast Statistics
===============
This is a plugin written for [Cast](https://github.com/Innovate-Technologies/Cast) that interacts with [ITFrame](https://github.com/Innovate-Technologies/ITFrame) to log listener sessions in a database and calculate the statistics.

To distribute the computer power the math is being done inside the Cast process, ITFrame acts as a backend for storage and forwarding the info to the outside only.
